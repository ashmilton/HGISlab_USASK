HGISlab_USASK
=============

A code repository for the Historical Geographic Information Systems lab at the University of Saskatchewan.

Since Janurary 2014 we've been working on learning python starting with the http://programminghistorian.org/ lessons. 

This is a repository to share code once we start to develop successful scripts and to ask each other questions or troubleshoot.
